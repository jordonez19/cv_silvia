<!--         <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <P>
            Silvia studied Medical Sciences for her doctorate from Rijksuniversiteit University in the
            Netherlands. Her Doctoral thesis was “tropical infectious diseases and HIV, working on
            observational studies and studies in-vitro” After her degree, In 2014 Silvia started working at Jazz
            Pharmaceutical as a Quality Specialist GMP in Dublin. In this role, Silvia was responsible for the
            GMP support to the Production of IMP for treatment of Leukaemia in children -Immunotherapy <br><br>
            Within a year in GMP at Jazz Pharmaceutical, Silvia moved into the newly formed clinical quality
            assurance department. At Jazz, she worked closely with the Quality Systems GMP group. The
            proximity to the GMP systems group and transition to the GCP quality team led to a collaboration
            between the two groups. Silvia was the GCP super user for the newly implemented Quality System
            at the company. She also worked on the review of the new set of SOPs for R&D-related controlled
            documents. At Jazz, she progressed in the next couple of years to a Clinical Quality Assurance
            Manager role. <br><br>
            As a Clinical Quality Assurance Manager at Jazz, Silvia was Reporting directly to the VP of R&D QA

            Pharmacovigilance Team, located in Oxford, and the R&D manufacturing team and the Quality
            Systems team, located in Dublin and Athlone. This role as the European GCP QA manager was key
            to achieving the integration of the different GXP Quality Assurance teams and the creation of the
            Global QA department. In this role, Silvia was one of the super user of the newly implemented
            electronic system ‘’Reliance’’. As a GCP Manager, Silvia was involved with CNS, Haematology trials. <br><br>
